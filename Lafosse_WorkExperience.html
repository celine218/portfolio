                <p>Although I do not have not done any internships or work in any work spaces I have gone to field trips to see the 
                 environments of different work spaces.
                     One field trip I have gone to was Cisco in San Jose on February 5, 2018.
                     During this field trip we were able to see how they prevent intruders from hacking the systems,
                         and also got a tour of the facility. We also got to see how they use their technology to improve everyday problems 
                         within large cities including parking, lighting, and security. I found this experience very important because I was 
                         able to see how teams are able to work together on different projects. </p>
                        <p>During my time in the class "Principles of Engineering," we have had multiple guest speakers to tell us about their 
                        experiences within different career fields.An influential speaker who I enjoyed was Maynard Holliday. He was a technical adviser, 
                        and ex-employee at Chernobyl. I was intrigued by his career because it opens up to a lot of opportunities in different companies, 
                        making it very flexible. I also found it very interesting on how he was able to multiple very different projects while still staying
                        within the same career field. </p>
