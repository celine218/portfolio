                            <p> Although I do not have not done any internships or work in any work spaces I have gone to field trips to see the 
                             environments of different work spaces. One field trip I have gone to was Cisco in San Jose on February 5, 2018.During this field trip we were able to see how they prevent intruders from hacking the systems,
                   Â          and also got a tour of the facility. We also got to see how they use their technology to improve everyday problems within large cities including parking, lighting, and security. I found this experience very important because I was able to see how teams are able to work together on different projects. </p>
                            <p>During my time in the class "Principles of Engineering," we have had multiple guest speakers to tell us about their 
                            experiences within different career fields.An influential speaker who I enjoyed was Maynard Holliday. He was a technical adviser, 
                            and ex-employee at Chernobyl. I was intrigued by his career because it opens up to a lot of opportunities in different companies, 
                            making it very flexible. I also found it very interesting on how he was able to multiple very different projects while still staying
                            within the same career field.</p>
