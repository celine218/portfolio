                <th scope="row"> <p>For this project our team was challenged to create a game within Scratch which was only 3 levels long. 
                The game had to be original and have good game play. For this game we choose to make the first level just a "capture the creatures" game,
                where you had to capture sea creatures during a certain amount of time. The second level was a maze game with the same concept as the
                first level except in a maze. The final level is a guessing game to find in which beach ball is the final fish.
                During this project I helped design and create the second level. I did majority of the coding, although my teammate made the base 
                of the code. As well as helping with the second level, I also helped connect all 3 levels together.</p>

                <th scope="row"> <p>During this project, my team and I were challenged to create a new invention based upon what we have learned this year. For this year, we chose to create "Posture +." 
                It is an inventor model and Netlogo program to simulate a chair which can track your health.
                The chair has a monitor on one arm to track how long you have been sitting and weather you have been sitting for too long. It will also track your BMI based on sensors
                on the bottom of the chair, and your height (which is inputted by the user).
                Throughout this project, I helped my team keep up with the documentation; as well as, creating the flowcharts for pages six and seven.
                In addition to the documentation, I also helped create the presentation we used during class and provided the logo found on the front. Finally, I was able to create the initial 
                sketch of the final product to base the inventor model off of.</p>

                <th scope="row"> <p> During this project, my parentner and I were challenged to follow a tutorial on how to make an app
                in MIT app inventor, then change it to make it our own. For us, we choose to follow the quiz app tutorial. We customized it to 
                be our own by changing the questions to a logo guessing game, adding a hint button, and giving it a score. The score would be considered
                the hardest part of the project, as other students told us they were able to get a negative score without explaining how. We spent 
                the majority of the time trying to figure out how the other students got a negative score, but we were unable to. 
                My contributions to the project was helping with the score, and creating the "hint" button. </p>
