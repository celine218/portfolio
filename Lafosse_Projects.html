                    <th scope="row"> <p>For this project our team was challenged to create a game within Scratch which was only 3 levels long. 
                    The game had to be original and have good game play. For this game we choose to make the first level just a "capture the creatures" game,
                    where you had to capture sea creatures during a certain amount of time. The second level was a maze game with the same concept as the
                    first level except in a maze. The final level is a guessing game to find in which beach ball is the final fish.
                    During this project I helped design and create the second level. I did majority of the coding, although my teammate made the base 
                    of the code. As well as helping with the second level, I also helped connect all 3 levels together.</p>

                    <th scope="row"><p> This project was a rather challenging one, as my partner and I were required to create an algorithm to turn an image
                    into a piece of art. The user must be able to insert whichever image they wanted, no matter size the size, and be given options on how they
                    would like it manipulated. My partner and I created an algorithem for the Green New Deal, an organization which fights climate change. The 
                    client can choose between four backgrounds, each with different slogans on the bottom. They can choose between a smoke background with the slogan
                    "Will you continue to be a Bystander?", a nature background with the slogan "Lets Keep Our Earth Beautiful", an iceberg background with the slogan 
                    "Our Earth is Crying, it can't handle anymore", and a factory with the slogan "Greenhouse gases are killing our Earth." Every one of these has a website
                    adress on the bottom and the Green New Deal in the bottom right. When an image is manipulated into any of these options, they are put in the center of the 
                    piece with a lowered opacity.
