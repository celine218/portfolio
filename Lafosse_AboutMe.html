                    <p> Hello, my name is Celine Lafosse, I am currently a junior at Dublin High School, and taking "Introduction to Computer Science" 
                    within my curriculum in Plan Lead The Way. This year I hope to learn many 
                    different skills such as Python, and app design. Next year, I will anticipate to continue my time in the Plan Lead The Way curriculum
                    in order to take the class "Video Game Design". Some of my hobbies are drawing and studying character design, 
                    which I've been doing for about 4 years. I hope I will be able to bring my characters to life in the games
                    that create in the future. </p>
                    
                    <p>I am a very dedicated student, and have never gone under 3.0 GPA throughout my middle school, or high school years. In the past I have
                    also been capable to solve challenging situations in engineering group projects very well.
                    As well as being a good student at Dublin High, I am currently taking a side class at the Academy of Arts University. 
                    Within this class, Introduction to 
                    3D modeling and Animation, I have gained much experience in Autodesk Maya, and very much enjoy it.</p>
                    
                   <p> During my time in the Engineering Academy, I have done many "Netlogo" projects as well as other coding projects, which you can find in the "project" tab up above. 
                    While working on these projects, 
                    I have found coding to be my stronghold. This subject has brought some of my favorite assignments to do within PLTW.
                    I hope to continue exploring different ways to express my passion for what I do. 
                    </p>
