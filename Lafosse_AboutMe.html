                    <p> Hello, my name is Celine Lafosse, I am currently a junior at Dublin High School, and taking "Introduction to Computer Science" 
                    within my curriculum in Plan Lead The Way (PLTW).During this year I am hoping to learn many 
                    different skills such as Python, App design, and much more. Next year, I anticipate to continue 
                    in order to get into "Video Game Design".Some of my hobbies are drawing and studying character design, 
                    which I've been doing for about 4 years now, and will hopefully able to bring my characters to life in the games
                    that I will create in the future. </p>
                    
                    <p>I am a very dedicated student, and have never gone under 3.0 GPA throughout my middle school, or high school years. In the past I have
                    also been capable to solve challenging situations in engineering group projects very well.
                    As well as being a good student at Dublin High, I am also currently taking a side class at the Academy of Arts University. 
                    Within this class, Introduction to 
                    3D modeling and Animation, I have gained much experience in Autodesk Maya, and very much enjoy it.</p>
                    
                   <p> During my time in the Engineering Academy, I have done many "Netlogo" projects as well as other coding projects, which you can find in the "project" tab up above. 
                    While working on these projects, 
                    I have found coding to be my stronghold. This subject has brought some of my favorite assignments to do within PLTW.
                    I hope to continue exploring different ways to express my passion for what I do. 
                    </p>
